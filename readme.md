Bootstrap Horror Blog Theme

A custom WordPress theme built for a horror blog, using Bootstrap 5 for responsive design and styled to evoke a dark, atmospheric feel.

This theme represents my first HTML-to-WordPress project, where I converted a static HTML design into a fully functional WordPress theme. Through this project, I aimed to bring a custom, horror-inspired aesthetic to WordPress, making it both flexible and user-friendly.
